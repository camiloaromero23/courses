# composition-api-journal

> **NOTE:** tests done with options API will fail in this project due to the router mock for the composition api. To check the correctness of all tests, copy the content from `jest.setup.js` to the `navbar.spec.js` file and delete line `#2` from the `jest.config.js` file. This is done due to a better test structure with the composition api.
